- Max Iterations: 1
- Max Time: 200 seconds
- Temperature: 0.5
- Outputs saved in structured format with markers:
  - üéµ MUSICAL CONTENT START üéµ
  - üéµ MUSICAL CONTENT END üéµ

**Global Model Parameters:**
- Decoding Method: Sample
- Max New Tokens: 250
- Top K: 50
- Top P: 0.95
- Model: WatsonX LLM
- Project Integration: CrewAI Framework

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/evilangelsaahi/MayaAI.git
cd MayaAI
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure API keys:
Create `.env` file in directory, an empty template is present save your API keys there and remove `_template` so that `config.py` file can map with your API keys:

```python
# WatsonX Configuration
WATSONX_APIKEY="PUT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"
WATSONX_PROJECT_ID="PUT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"
WATSONX_URL="PUT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"
WATSONX_PLATFORM_URL="PUT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"
WATSONX_MODEL_ID="PUT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"

# Model Parameters are hardcoded in code but can be put here as well
DECODING_METHOD=sample
MAX_NEW_TOKENS=200
MIN_NEW_TOKENS=0
TEMPERATURE=0
TOP_K=1
TOP_P=1

# Serper Configuration
SERPER_API_KEY="PUT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"

# NewsAPIWrapper
NEWS_API_KEY="not-using-this-tool"

# OpenWeatherMap
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY="PUT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"

```

## Usage

Run the main application:
```bash
python agent.py
```
or
```bash
python3 agent.py
```

The application provides an interactive menu with options to:
1. Get career development advice
2. Research music trends
3. Generate creative content
4. Save conversation history
5. Exit the application


## Language Model Parameters: Quick Reference

- **Decoding Method: "sample"**
  * Randomly selects next tokens based on their probability distribution
  * Provides more varied output than "greedy" decoding (which always selects most likely token)

- **Max New Tokens: 250**
  * Limits output length to 250 new tokens (roughly 800 characters in English)
  * Prevents excessively long responses and controls computation time

- **Temperature: 0.4**
  * Controls randomness in output (scale 0-1)
  * Lower setting (0.5) favors consistency and predictability over creativity
  * Creates more focused, deterministic responses

- **Top-k: 50**
  * Restricts token selection to only the 50 most probable options
  * Filters out unlikely or nonsensical choices
  * Balances output diversity with quality

- **Top-p: 0.95**
  * Uses "nucleus sampling" to dynamically select tokens
  * Considers only tokens whose cumulative probability reaches 95%
  * More adaptable than top-k, adjusts based on probability distribution

This configuration creates reliable, consistent outputs with moderate creativity and reasonable length constraints.

**Note: There's always a tradeoff between creativity and being right, these params are chosen to suit the best case for this project.**
**Sometimes I noticed right answer in the thought process of Agent, but again in final answer it apologizes for being wrong.**

## Outputs

All generated content (lyrics, chords, etc.) is automatically saved to the `outputs` directory with timestamped filenames in the format:
`save` text need to be prompted to AI agent to save upto last two conversations 
```
outputs/creative_output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt
```
